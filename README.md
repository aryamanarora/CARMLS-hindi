# CARMLS Hindi

This is a centralized repository of the work of the CARMLS research group on SNACS (Semantic Network of Adposition and Case Supersenses) for Hindi.

Currently, this includes the entire annotated *Nanhā Rājkumār* (*The Little Prince*) in Hindi.

Some open guidelines issues are stored (expectedly) as issues on the repo.
